# ansible-skeleton

After moving from computer to computer and dealing with different segments of servers, I found myself always returning to the Ansible Best Practices page to get a refresher on what to do with my directory layout.

That's repeating work, no?  
The very thing we're trying to avoid in using the product.

So, I created this repo that mimics the layout they've suggested.
Hopefully this will save you some time as well!

As the Ansible team mentions, you should definitely take a read through their documentation and adopt whatever structure (or lack thereof) that suits your project.

Enjoy!
